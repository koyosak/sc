# 140 character assignment

## Challenges I faced

##### The challenge I faced was definitely the limited number of characters. I didn't expect 140 characters to be this limited. My "short" draft already was 180 words, and I had to give up lines of code :( With that being said, I enjoyed playing around with the patch I found interesting in all of Codealong examples and tweak those around. I ended up using Pseq for this assignment.

## The patch I created

	a = (note: [-12, 7, 12, 16]);
	b = (note: [-19, 9, 14, 17]);
	c = (note: [-17, 2, 5, 11]);
	d = (note: [-24, 4, 7, 12]);

	Pseq([a, b, c, d]).play;
	
###### It is 138 characters in total!
###### I also played with tuning and had fun with those as well!!
	
##### While I was playing with the Pseq example in one of the Codealong files, I thought it'd be cool to do the sequence of chords for cadence. The a chord isa C major chord with a third on top of the chord (I), the b chord is a D minor chord (II6), the c chord is a G major chord (V7), and a C major chord for the d chord (I). I wanted to add more chords to make the sequence fancier, but I had to give up some of the chords like F major (IV) for the Plagal cadence, A minor (VI) for the Deceptive cadence etc,,,

#### Although there were very little amount of characters I could work with, I had so much fun with this assignment!
